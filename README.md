# Diabetes Prediction Project 

This project is a simple machine learning application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on medical input features.

It uses:
- A trained Random Forest model
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing
- Streamlit for building the web interface

The goal is to assist in early diabetes prediction using patient health data.
